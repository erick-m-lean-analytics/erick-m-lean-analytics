# 👋 Hi, I'm Erick  
### Lean Practitioner | Operations Optimisation | Transitioning into AI Engineering

I’m a Certified Lean Manufacturing Trainer with deep experience improving processes across manufacturing, logistics, R&D, distribution, and service operations. My background is built on **structured problem‑solving, system optimisation, and data‑driven decision‑making** — and I’m now expanding that foundation into **AI engineering**.

I’m particularly interested in how AI, automation, and intelligent systems can enhance operational performance, reduce waste, and support better real‑time decision‑making.

## 🔄 What I’m Transitioning Toward  
I’m building capability in:

- Python for data and automation  
- Machine learning fundamentals  
- Applied AI for operations and process optimisation  
- Data workflows and analytical modelling  
- MLOps and deployment basics  

My goal is to combine **Lean thinking + AI** to create smarter, more adaptive operational systems.
